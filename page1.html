   <h2>Positions</h2>
    <p>there are 6 positions on the court, as illustrated above</p>
    
    <p>
        <p  ><strong>1 & 2: <a class="titlelink" href="https://www.dicaseducacaofisica.info/en/setter-in-volleyball/"target="blank">Setter</a> & 
            <a class="titlelink" href="https://volleyballindex.com/opposite-hitter-position/"target="blank">Rightside</a></strong> </a>
        <p><img src="img/setter.jpg"
        width="500px "></p>
       
            <p>The role of setters is to 'set up' the hitters to attack. 
                They primarily take second contact.</p>
            <p>Rightsides hit and block from the right side of the court</p>

        <p><strong>3 : <a class="titlelink" href="https://www.liveabout.com/volleyball-positions-middle-blocker-3429245" target="blank" >Middle Blockers</a></Strong></p>

        width="500px"></p>
            <p>Middles play an important role in defense at the net. They are responsible for preventing opponent attakers from scoring by blocking.
                They traditionally do not serve receive or play defense, but run various attacks in the front row. 
            </p>

        <p><strong>4 & 6: <a class="titlelink" href="https://www.liveabout.com/volleyball-positions-outside-hitter-3429247" target="blank">Leftsides</a></strong></p>
            <p><img src="img/left.jpg.crdownload"
                width="500px"></p>
                <p>Leftsides are the leading attackers on the court. They attack, defend, serve receive, block and serve.</p>

        <p><strong>5: <a class="titlelink" href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libero_(volleybal)" target="blank">Libero</a></strong></p>
            <p><img src="img/libero.jpg"
            width="500px"></p>
                <p>Liberos are the leadeing passers on the court. They substitue the middle after they serve and play defense in their place. 
                    They are not permitted to play front row or serve, overhand contact the ball in front of the thre meter line, or contact the ball above the plane of the net. </p>
